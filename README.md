CodeRush
Overview
CodeRush is an interactive 2D arcade game designed to make learning to code more engaging and fun. Based on a user-generated prompt, the game creates an adventure where players navigate through obstacles and paths, learning programming concepts along the way. The game integrates code logic challenges where the player must use if-else statements to overcome obstacles, providing both a fun and educational experience.

Features:
Customizable Learning Experience: Players input a theme or concept they'd like to learn, and the game adapts to generate relevant challenges.
Interactive Game Map: The game generates a dynamic, 2D map with paths and obstacles based on the learning prompt.
Learning Focused: In each challenge, players must write solutions using if-else logic to progress, simulating real coding problems.
Player Progression: The player character moves through the map, overcoming obstacles by solving coding challenges that help reinforce programming concepts.
Technologies Used:
Pygame: A Python library used for creating the graphical interface and animations.
OpenAI GPT-3: Powers the backend for generating dynamic content, including the storyline and map based on user input.
Python: Main programming language used for the game logic and user interaction.

Installation
To run CodeRush, you'll need to have Python installed along with some required libraries. Follow the steps below to set it up:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coderush-game.git
cd coderush-game
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install the required libraries.

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file contains the following dependencies:

txt
Copy
pygame==2.5.2
openai==0.10.1
3. Set Up OpenAI API Key
To interact with OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, you need an API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

Go to OpenAI's website and sign up for an API key.
Once you have your API key, set it as an environment variable on your machine.
On Windows, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Alternatively, you can directly set the OPENAI_API_KEY in your code, though it is not recommended for production.

4. Run the Game
Once you've completed the setup, you can run the game by executing the following:

bash
Copy
python main.py
This will start the game and open a Pygame window where you can interact with the game, enter prompts, and start learning to code!

Usage
Game Flow:
Start Screen: The game starts with a simple "Start" button. Once clicked, you are taken to the Prompt Screen.
Prompt Screen: You are asked to enter a concept you wish to learn. For example, “Python loops”, “Data types”, or “Functions”.
Map Generation: Based on your input, a dynamic 2D map is generated, and the player must navigate through it using logic to avoid obstacles and find the correct path.
Learning: To progress through the game, you must write correct if-else logic in the terminal that affects the game’s path and progression.
Goal: Once the player successfully navigates to the goal (end of the map), the game ends, and a summary of the learning progress is displayed.
